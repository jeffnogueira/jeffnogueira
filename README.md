### Hi there 👋

I'm Jefferson and I have 4 years of experience in Technology, today I'm a full stack developer at [everis](https://www.everis.com/brazil/pt-br/home-br) and graduating in information systems at [UNIPAM](https://unipam.edu.br/). <br />
Even managing to develop very well in the backend, I have a greater focus on the frontend, in the creation of web applications and mobiles.<br />
I have always been passionate about technology and innovation, with a slightly more general profile I had contact with the following tools:

⚡ Programming: HTML5, CSS3, PHP, CakePHP, Wordpress, JS/TS, ReactJS, Angular2+, NodeJS, Express, KnexJS, Sequelize, TypeORM, React Native, IONIC, C# (academic), Java (academic). <br />
☁️ Cloud Computing: AWS (RDS, S3), Google Cloud, Heroku. <br />
🖥️ Devops: Git. <br />
📉 Database: Oracle, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Firebase, DataStore. <br />
